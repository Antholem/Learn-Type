                    <h3>What are web frameworks and why you need them?</h3>
                    <p>
                        "A software framework that is designed to support the development of web applications, including web services, web
                        resources, and web APIs," according to GeeksforGeeks, is what <b>"web application frameworks"</b> or <b>"web frameworks"</b> are.
                        online frameworks are, to put it simply, a piece of software that provides a mechanism to build and operate online
                        applications. As a result, you are spared the necessity to code independently and search for any errors and flaws.
                        <br><br>
                        In earlier days of <b>web app development</b>, web frameworks were introduced as a means to end hand-coding of applications
                        where just the developer of a particular app could change it. That was long ago, now we have web-specific languages and
                        the trouble with changing an appâ€™s structure is resolved because of the arrival of a general performance. Now, depending
                        upon your task you may choose one web framework that fulfills all your requirements or converges multiple frameworks.
