                        <b>Tailwind CSS</b>
                        <br>
                        Adam Wathan invented Tailwind CSS. A low-level, utility-focused CSS framework is called Tailwind CSS. It provides
                        special classes that may be used to design an element on a webpage right away. It enables programmers to quickly design
                        user interfaces that are unique. One of the most well-liked utility-first CSS libraries is Tailwind CSS.

                        It is challenging for developers to design a unique user interface because most user interface technologies already have
                        built-in components and functionality. However, Tailwind CSS offers a great deal of control and flexibility over how an
                        element will appear and behave. This makes it ideal for designing distinctive and personalized user experiences.

                        A free open-source CSS framework called Bootstrap is used to build mobile and web apps that are responsive. It is a
                        front end development framework that prioritizes mobility. For various components, it has HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
                        templates. Jacob Thorton and Mark Otto created Bootstrap. One of the most often used frameworks is this one. One of the
                        most well-liked open-source frameworks is it.
