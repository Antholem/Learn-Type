                        If youâ€™re entirely new to web development and coding, congrats for taking the first step!
                        To get you started the right way, here are a handful of useful beginner-level articles to browse through first:
                        <br><br>
                        1. <b>Visit my post to learn what web development and coding are.</b> You will learn how the Internet functions, what programming
                        languages can accomplish for you, and what tools you need from the free coding book. You'll learn what web developers do
                        as well.
                        <br><br>
                        2. <b>First, learn HTML and CSS.</b> They are the most crucial, core resources you require to design websites professionally.
                        Start with free lessons from freeCodeCamp or Codecademy. Visit my favorite HTML and CSS classes for more resources.
                        <br><br>
                        3. <b>Get to know jQuery and JavaScript.</b> You'll make use of them to give your static web pages liveliness. They'll be your
                        primary tools if you wish to work as a front-end web developer, together with HTML and CSS. Please don't hesitate to
                        utilize the free tools available on Codecademy and FreeCodeCamp.
                        <br><br>
                        4. <b>As you progress through your online classes, practice your abilities frequently.</b> Make sure you apply what you learn to
                        your own projects rather than merely following instructions step-by-step. By doing so, you'll be able to put all the
                        tools you've learned to use and create genuine websites from beginning.
